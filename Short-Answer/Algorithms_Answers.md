#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) constant increase


b) O(n^2) there are two operations that affect the runtime. the first is a for loop and the while loop works like another for loop.


c) O(n) recursive, but increase is constant

## Exercise II

A binary search tree would be a potential solution to the problem. Could start at thge top floor of the range of floors, and then
cut search space in half based on the result of the egg.

The runtime complexity of the solution would be O(log(n)) as it is a binary search tree solution.
